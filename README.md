# Excel-Challenge
**75-days challenge Part - 1 Excel Project**

**Day - 1**

This Excel file has 2 spreadsheets, one called SUPERSTORE SALES DATASET which has raw data which has been cleaned and free of duplicates. The second worksheet has my DAY-1 work insights showing the total sales amount, average sales per transaction and total number of transactions. I have used the SUM(), AVERAGE() and COUNT() in Excel to calculate different values.
